# Next Steps

* Forward covid615.com to the Davidson county
* Set up dynamic page titles so that the page title is localized to each county and state
* Use chart.js to chart new cases, total cases and deaths
* Add login and pundit so that only someone with an admin account can edit data
* Create a background job that grabs the data from Johns Hopkins via the api at misssissippicovid.com


## Ideas for features
* Create a "City" scaffold that allows you to associate counties with cities. For Nashville, it would just be Davidson county, but a city like Atlanta might have many associated counties.
* Create dashboard pages similar to county pages for states (use FIPS to associate them?)
