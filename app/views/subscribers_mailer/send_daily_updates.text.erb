I'm Lee—Founder of McAlilly Creative Partners (mcalilly.com). Covid-19 is a confusing disease. I built and launched this site on March 26th after seeing 10 days of Metro Nashville Covid-19 positive case numbers publicised without context of prior results. I believe viewing each day's covid data in the context of prior reports provides a clearer understanding of how our community is being impacted by the disease.
