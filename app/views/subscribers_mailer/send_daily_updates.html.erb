I'm Lee—Founder of McAlilly Creative partners. Covid-19 is a confusing disease. I built and launched this site on ___ date after seeing ___ days of Metro Nashville Covid-19 positive case numbers publicised without context of prior results. I believe viewing each day's covid data in the context of prior reports provides a clearer understanding of how our community is being impacted by the disease.
